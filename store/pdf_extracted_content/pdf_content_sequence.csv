 Key
takeaways: Shift
to
Agentic
Workflows: Traditional AI relies on static,  one-off prompts, while agentic workflows enable AI to self- reflect, use external tools, plan tasks, and collaborate,  improving reasoning and performance. ● Iteration
Boosts
Performance: Even weaker models (e.g.,  GPT-3.5) can outperform stronger ones (e.g., GPT-4) when  optimized through iterative workflows. ● Real-World
Applications: AI Agents will enhance customer  support, legal analysis, healthcare diagnostics, and software  development, driving efficiency. ● 1 / 15"

of
independent
agency
capabilities:
AI Agency is a spectrum, running from  current systems with limited agency that only perform specific tasks under narrowly defined  conditions to future systems with full agency that
learn
from
their
environment,
make
 decisions
and
perform
tasks
independently. Current LLM-based systems, like copilots  and virtual assistans, are more adaptable and can tackle more complex tasks than previous  systems. However, they remain unreliable and require huan
supervision; as such, they  represent early examples of AI agents rather than the full-fledged agents promised by future  AI models.     5.1.2 Multiagent
systems
(MAS):
 transparency, innovative  training, and open-source  collaboration to challenge  AI giants. Conclusion：the current development of technology can support the commercial  application of a large number of mature scenarios, and can also support the application  of embryonic C- end products. However, if AI is required to undertake more complex  work, there is still a long space for development in long-term memory, multimodal, API  integration and multi-Agent collaboration. Gartner
definition: MAS is a multiagent system(MAS) is a type of AI system composed of multiple, independent,  interacting agents, each capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions. the  composition of MAS may vary: 4 / 15"

Agent Cost: AI agents from big tech and leading LLM developers like OpenAI and Anthropic will  pressure private players in 2025 due to their cost advantages. Distribution: OpenAI’s ChatGPT, with 400M weekly users, has a significant distribution edge as  it rolls out agents like Operator in January 2025. Risk: 40% of corporate strategy teams (CB Insights) prioritize risk management in genAI vendor  selection. AI agents require access to sensitive data and operate autonomously, raising  concerns over privacy, liability, and security.
