AI giants.
Conclusion：the current development of technology can support the commercial
application of a large number of mature scenarios, and can also support the application
of embryonic C- end products. However, if AI is required to undertake more complex
work, there is still a long space for development in long-term memory, multimodal, API
integration and multi-Agent collaboration.
5. Future trends
5.1.1 Improvement of independent agency capabilities: AI Agency is a spectrum, running from
current systems with limited agency that only perform specific tasks under narrowly defined
conditions to future systems with full agency that learn from their environment, make
decisions and perform tasks independently. Current LLM-based systems, like copilots
and virtual assistans, are more adaptable and can tackle more complex tasks than previous
systems. However, they remain unreliable and require huan supervision; as such, they
represent early examples of AI agents rather than the full-fledged agents promised by future
AI models.
5.1.2 Multiagent systems (MAS):
Gartner definition:
MAS is a multiagent system(MAS) is a type of AI system composed of multiple, independent,
interacting agents, each capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions. the
composition of MAS may vary:"
