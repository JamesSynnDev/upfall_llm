"● By architecture: MAS architectures exist in a spectrum, from predefined sets of
agents with centralized control and deterministic behavior and outcomes, to highly
dynamic, constantly evolving collectives of agents with distributed control,
adaptive behavior and emerging outcomes at the system level.
● By agent type/role: MASs may also vary by type of agent; sometimes all agents
have the same role, while in other cases agents play different roles, such as
coordinator, guard, communicator, sensor, solver or actuator.
● By technique: Agents may also vary in terms of the AI technique that enables
each of them, depending on their task in the collective.
Bottleneck：A distributed agent network and interconnection protocol integrating
cloud and edge: A globally unified AI OS is needed. A Dev Agent startup, founded by a
former Android founder, stated: ""We need an AI moment similar to the Android revolution.""
